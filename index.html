                <p id="about-me">
                    My name is Caleb Korson. I have a degree in chemical engineering from Michigan Tech University.
                    I worked for General Motors for 4 years as a Paint Process Engineer and Automation Specialist. 
                    I currently work for Consolidated Nuclear Securities as a Process Engineer, but I am looking expand 
                    my skill set and branch out from engineering.
                    With this in mind, I am currently taking the University of Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp to earn a 
                    certificate as a full stack web developer. <br>
                    <br>
                    I have a passion for running and hiking. Two hobbies I am lucky enough to share with my wife and two dogs.
                    I currently live in Oak Ridge, TN. I hope you enjoy scrolling through my Portfolio!
